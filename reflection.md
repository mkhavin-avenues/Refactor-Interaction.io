- Initially, understanding how to structure conditionals was challenging, especially with nesting and combining multiple conditions.
- Now, I find it easier to visualize conditionals as a series of questions guiding the program’s flow, making complex scenarios more manageable.
- I’m proud of my improved debugging skills, which help me quickly spot and fix mistakes in my conditional logic.
